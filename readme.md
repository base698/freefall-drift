Simple Free Drift Explorer v0.1
----------

Meant to be a more robust example of simulation here: http://www.omniskore.com/freefall_drift2.html

Features
----

Change wind speeds, number of jumpers, and opening altitude.  Heat map to show vertical proximity under canopy at 2500 ft.

TODO
----------

- Lots of Physics Changes!
- More UI styling.
- Clouds.
- Persist simulation runs.
- Link sharing for good runs to illustrate a point.  
- Heat map for horizontal proximity.
